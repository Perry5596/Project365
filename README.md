## ✨ What is Project 365?

Project 365 is a Notion-like planning web app that helps you:

- Define a goal (fitness, business, learning, creative, etc.)
- Timebox it to ≤ 365 days
- Let AI design a detailed plan with milestones and daily actions
- Track your progress, adapt the plan, and “feel the clock” as the deadline approaches

The core idea: if you follow the plan exactly, it should be **unreasonable** for you to fail.

You bring the goals and discipline.  
The app brings structure, visibility, and relentless reminders.

---

## 🌐 Web-Only Architecture (for now)

Right now, Project 365 is being built as a **web-only application**:

- Built with **React + TypeScript** and **Vite** as the bundler.
- Designed primarily for a **desktop browser** experience (laptop/monitor viewport).
- Uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling and a clean design system.
- Future directions (native desktop wrappers, mobile) can reuse the same core logic and components, but all initial effort is focused on the browser.

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts

- **Projects** – Each project is a goal with a start date and a target date (up to 365 days).
- **Milestones** – Monthly/quarterly checkpoints that break the journey into chunks.
- **Daily Tasks** – Simple, check-off-able actions generated by AI.
- **Missed Tasks** – Tasks you didn’t complete on time move into a weekly “missed” bucket.
- **Days Remaining / Days Behind** – Constant feedback on how close you are to the deadline and how far behind (or ahead) you are.

Think of it as a focused, goal-specific workspace that behaves like a living document.

---

## 🧠 AI-Assisted Planning

Project 365 uses the OpenAI API (with **your** API key) to:

- Generate an initial, fully structured plan for each project:
  - Milestones and checkpoints
  - Daily/weekly routines
  - Realistic intensity based on your constraints
- Continuously adjust the plan when you:
  - Change the deadline
  - Fall behind schedule
  - Decide to make the goal more ambitious
- Rewrite, re-scope, or completely replace the plan on command

You’ll be able to:

- Ask the AI: _“Shorten this goal to 90 days.”_
- Ask: _“I missed most of last week. Replan the next two weeks.”_
- Ask: _“I’m ahead of schedule. Make this goal harder.”_

All project state is visible and editable – the AI just operates on the same data model you see.

## 🎛 App Feel & Design

The UX is inspired by:

- **Notion** – clean, minimal, block-oriented layout
- **Cal.com / CalAI** – modern scheduling feel with strong emphasis on time and commitment
- **useMotion** – smooth, subtle motion and interactions

Planned UI characteristics (web-only for now):

- Project dashboard with cards showing:
  - Title, days remaining, and status
- Detailed project view with sections for:
  - Today • This Week • Plan • Missed Tasks
- A built-in AI assistant panel that can:
  - Explain the plan
  - Suggest adjustments
  - Apply structural changes to the project

All styled using **Tailwind CSS** to keep the dev loop fast and the design consistent.

## 🗺️ Roadmap (High-Level)

This project is under active early development. Planned phases:

### Phase 1 – Web Foundations (current focus)

- [ ] Vite + React + TypeScript setup
- [ ] Tailwind CSS configuration and base design system
- [ ] Local-first storage (e.g. IndexedDB/localStorage abstraction)
- [ ] Basic project + task data model
- [ ] Web dashboard & project screens
- [ ] Manual tasks (no AI yet)

### Phase 2 – AI Planning

- [ ] OpenAI integration (user-provided API key)
- [ ] Initial AI-generated project plans:
  - [ ] Milestones
  - [ ] Daily/weekly tasks
- [ ] “Regenerate plan” and “Shorten timeline” actions
- [ ] “Adjust difficulty” (easier/harder) actions

### Phase 3 – Progress & Accountability

- [ ] Days remaining / days behind calculations
- [ ] Automatic “missed tasks” handling:
  - [ ] Move incomplete tasks to weekly missed list
  - [ ] Weekly wipe of missed tasks
- [ ] Notifications & reminders (web-first):
  - [ ] Daily plan reminders
  - [ ] “You’re behind” nudges
  - [ ] “You’re ahead – want to ramp up?” prompts

### Phase 4 – Polish & Ecosystem

- [ ] Theming (light/dark) and design system refinement with Tailwind
- [ ] Better desktop web experience (hotkeys, layout tweaks)
- [ ] Contributor docs, issue templates, and a stable `v0.1.0` release
- [ ] Explore desktop wrappers & mobile clients as future directions

## 👐 Open Source Philosophy

Project 365 is designed to be:

- **Fully open source** – you can audit, fork, extend, and self-host.
- **Locally respectful** – the OpenAI API key is provided by you and used directly from your app.
- **Extensible** – the domain model, AI prompts, and UI are intentionally modular:
  - Want a different AI provider? Swap the client.
  - Want new goal types or metrics? Extend the domain layer.
  - Want custom visualizations? Build on top of the existing components.

Community contributions are welcome once the core architecture stabilizes:
- New views/components
- Better prompts and schemas
- Integrations (calendar, wearable data, etc.)
- Documentation and examples
