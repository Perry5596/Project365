# Project 365 – Global Rules

## 0. Vision

- This is an **AI-assisted goal tracker, planner, and strategist** for achieving any goal within **≤365 days**.
- The app should feel like a mix of **Notion + Cal.com/CalAI + useMotion**:
  - Minimal, clean, block-based layouts
  - Soft, modern typography
  - Strong focus on clarity: “What do I need to do today to stay on track?”
- The core promise: **if the user follows the plan to the letter, it should be unreasonable that they fail.**

## 1. Tech & Architecture

- **Language:** TypeScript everywhere.
- **Client:** React Native (with Expo), organized to support:
  - Mobile and web in dev.
  - Future expansion to Windows/macOS via React Native for Windows / native shells.
- **Data layer:**
  - Local-first (no backend in v1).
  - Prefer SQLite (e.g. via `expo-sqlite` or similar) or a small strongly-typed local storage layer.
- **AI integration:**
  - OpenAI API.
  - User provides **their own API key** in a secure settings screen.
  - AI calls are wrapped in a dedicated module (`/src/ai`) with:
    - Typed request/response interfaces.
    - Zod validation on responses.
    - Clear separation between prompt building and app logic.
- **State management:**
  - Use a lightweight store such as **Zustand** for global app state (projects, tasks, settings).
  - Use React Query (TanStack Query) only if/when a remote backend is added later.
- **Routing/navigation:**
  - Use React Navigation or Expo Router with a clear structure:
    - `Home / Dashboard`
    - `Project detail`
    - `Missed tasks`
    - `Settings`

When in doubt: keep it **client-only and simple** for v1. We can layer tRPC + backend later.

## 2. Domain Concepts (Canonical Names)

Always use these names consistently across code, UI, and prompts:

- **Project**: A single goal initiative with:
  - `title`
  - `description`
  - `startDate`
  - `targetDate` (≤ 365 days from start; may be shorter)
  - `status` (planned, active, completed, cancelled)
  - `timeframe` breakdown: weekly, monthly, quarterly, final.
- **Milestone**:
  - Intermediate “checkpoints” for the project (e.g. “Build MVP”, “Hit X revenue”, “Bench 225x5”).
  - Each milestone has its own `targetDate`.
- **Planned Task** (AI-generated):
  - A concrete action item with:
    - `date` (day planned for)
    - `title`
    - `description`
    - `effortEstimate` (e.g. S/M/L)
    - `status` (pending, done, missed)
- **Missed Task**:
  - A planned task that wasn’t completed on its scheduled day.
  - Moves into a **weekly “Missed Tasks” list**.
  - Missed tasks persist in that weekly bucket until the week ends, then are wiped (per spec).
- **Progress Metrics**:
  - Quantitative and/or qualitative fields that can be tracked over time per project.
- **Schedule metrics**:
  - `daysRemaining`: `targetDate - today`
  - `daysBehind`: computed based on divergence from the ideal timeline.

These core domain objects should live in a central module like `src/domain`.

## 3. UX / Behavior Requirements (High-Level)

- **Project creation flow:**
  - User sets:
    - Project name, description.
    - Start date (default: today).
    - Target date (max +365 days).
  - User optionally describes:
    - Current level / baseline.
    - Constraints (time per day/week, resources).
  - On submit, AI generates:
    - A full plan of milestones and tasks across the timeframe.
    - A daily/weekly structure that is **realistically executable**.
- **AI plan generation:**
  - Designed so that following it strictly makes failure “unreasonable”.
  - Includes:
    - Clear milestones.
    - Daily/weekly tasks.
    - Checkpoints to reassess and adjust.
- **Open configuration:**
  - The project page is heavily editable (like Notion).
  - AI can modify **anything** when asked:
    - Regenerate from scratch.
    - Compress timeline.
    - Adjust difficulty if user is ahead.
- **Tasks & missed tasks:**
  - Daily recommended tasks are generated on project creation (can be updated).
  - If a task isn’t completed by end of its day:
    - Move it into that week’s **Missed Tasks** list.
  - At the start of a new week:
    - Missed tasks list for the previous week is wiped.
- **Progress adaptation:**
  - If **behind schedule**:
    - Surface `daysBehind` and push more urgent / focused recommendations.
  - If **ahead of schedule**:
    - Offer options to:
      - Finish earlier (shorten timeline).
      - Increase difficulty (harder goals).
- **Notifications/reminders:**
  - Configurable in settings:
    - Time-of-day reminders.
    - “You are X days behind” nudges.
    - “You’re ahead; want to ramp up?” prompts.
  - Must be **opt-in** and respect OS notification settings.

## 4. Code Style & Quality

- Strict TypeScript:
  - `"strict": true`
  - Avoid `any`; prefer generics and proper types.
- Use functional React components and hooks.
- Keep components small and presentational where possible.
- Use a central **design system**:
  - Color tokens (light/dark).
  - Typographic scale.
  - Component primitives for:
    - Buttons, cards, list items, tags, chips, progress bars.
- Prefer **composition over inheritance**.
- Write clear docstrings for:
  - Domain models.
  - AI prompt/response builders.
  - Scheduling / progress algorithms.

Testing (minimal but real):

- At least unit tests for:
  - Schedule math (`daysRemaining`, `daysBehind`).
  - Mapping from AI JSON → internal types.
- Avoid brittle snapshot tests for UI early on; focus on logic.

## 5. AI Usage – Global Guidelines

- Always **validate model output** with Zod schemas.
- Fail safely:
  - If AI output is malformed, show a user-friendly error and allow retry.
- Keep prompts:
  - Deterministic and structured.
  - Focused on the **domain entities** above instead of arbitrary prose.
- Use **model selection** from user settings:
  - Provide defaults (e.g., GPT-5 for full plan generation, lighter models for small edits) but let user override.
- Consider:
  - Caching AI responses if they are expensive and re-used.

## 6. Open Source & Maintainability

- Repo should include:
  - `README.md` with:
    - Project vision.
    - Quickstart.
    - Architecture overview.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
  - A permissive license (e.g., MIT).
- Break things into clearly named modules:
  - `src/domain`
  - `src/ai`
  - `src/state`
  - `src/ui`
  - `src/screens`
  - `src/services` (notifications, storage).
- No magic numbers. If a rule is important (e.g., max 365 days, weekly wipe of missed tasks), define it as a constant.

## 7. Cursor-Specific Instructions

- When generating or editing code:
  - Respect the architecture and type definitions found in `src/domain`.
  - Prefer to add new small modules over bloating existing ones.
  - Do not introduce a backend or tRPC unless a specific task or rule file asks for it.
- When editing prompt logic:
  - Keep prompt templates in dedicated files inside `src/ai/prompts`.
  - Avoid inlining long string literals inside React components.
