# UI & Theming Rules

## Overall Look & Feel

Target a hybrid of:

- **Notion**:
  - Clean, minimal.
  - Blocks/cards, translucent panels.
- **Cal.com / CalAI**:
  - Subtle rounded corners.
  - Strong but soft typography.
  - Clear emphasis on primary actions.
- **useMotion**:
  - Smooth micro-interactions.
  - Subtle motion, not flashy.

## Platform Focus

- **Web-first**:
  - Primary experience is desktop browser (laptop/monitor).
  - Layout should assume a wide viewport (e.g. 1200–1440px) and scale down gracefully.
- Plan designs so they can later map nicely to mobile and native desktop, but **optimize now for web**.

## Layout Principles

- Main app layout (web):

  - Left sidebar:
    - Projects list (with status and days remaining).
    - Quick filters (Active, Completed, Behind schedule).
  - Main content:
    - Project overview, timeline, tasks, missed tasks.
  - Right-side panel (optional):
    - AI assistant pane or project insights.

- Within a project:
  - Top: Project header (title, goal summary, days remaining, days behind/ahead).
  - Middle: Tabs or sections:
    - “Today”
    - “Week”
    - “Plan” (milestones)
    - “Missed Tasks”
  - Bottom or side: AI “Ask anything” bar.

Use flexbox/grid and NativeWind utility classes to create responsive layouts.

## Component System

Define and reuse primitives in `src/ui/components`:

- `Button` (primary, secondary, ghost)
- `Card` (with optional header, body, footer)
- `Tag` / `Badge` (for statuses)
- `ProgressBar` (for % of tasks completed)
- `StatTile` (for key metrics: days remaining, days behind, completion %)
- `TaskItem` (checkbox, title, subtasks, due status)
- `SectionHeader` for grouping content

Each should be styled with **NativeWind**:

- Use Tailwind-like classes: e.g. `className="rounded-2xl bg-surface px-4 py-3 shadow-sm"`
- Keep theme-consistent tokens (colors, radii) referenced via design tokens mapped into classes.

### Theming

Centralized theme in `src/ui/theme.ts` with tokens:

- Colors (example names, not exact values):
  - `color.background`, `color.backgroundAlt`
  - `color.surface`, `color.surfaceAlt`
  - `color.textPrimary`, `color.textSecondary`, `color.textMuted`
  - `color.accent`, `color.accentSoft`
  - `color.danger`, `color.warning`, `color.success`
- Typography:
  - `font.heading`, `font.body`, `font.mono`
  - Sizes: `xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl`
- Radii:
  - `radius.sm`, `radius.md`, `radius.lg`, `radius.xl` (cards/buttons should feel soft, e.g. `radius.lg`).
- Shadows:
  - `shadow.sm`, `shadow.md` for subtle depth.

Apply these tokens through NativeWind configuration (tailwind config theme extensions) so components can use consistent classes such as `bg-background`, `text-primary`, etc.

Support both **light and dark modes** from day one, with a simple toggle in settings.

### Interactions

- Task completion:
  - Checkbox or tap area with subtle animation (scale/fade).
  - Completed tasks fade slightly, but remain readable.
- Missed tasks:
  - Visually distinct (e.g. tag “Missed” + subtle warning color).
- “Days remaining” & “days behind”:
  - Always visible in project header.
  - “Behind” uses warning/danger color; “Ahead” uses success/positive color.

### Accessibility

- Aim for WCAG AA contrast.
- Support:
  - Font size scaling (respect browser zoom).
  - Keyboard navigation:
    - Focus states on key interactive components.
    - Tab order that makes sense.
- Avoid color-only status indicators; always include icon/text.

### AI Assistant UI

- AI interaction should:
  - Live in a panel with chat-like UI, but focused on **commands that modify the project**.
  - Allow user to:
    - Preview changes before applying when possible.
  - Show:
    - “Summary of change” before committing.

### Cursor Guidance

- When adding new components:
  - Put them in `src/ui/components`.
  - Export them from `src/ui/index.ts` for easy imports.
- Prefer NativeWind classes over inline styles.
- Avoid:
  - Copy-pasted markup; refactor shared patterns into components.
